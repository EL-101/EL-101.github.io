        <p>Given the recent global events over the last few years, along with the growing popularity of artificial intelligence across all sectors, we believe that it is important and necessary to look further into these areas and explore the new impacts and trends within the education and learning environment.   
    
        As a society, we have seen and experienced major events in the last several years that shaped how we currently operate on a day-to-day basis, with changes seen across all industries. Because of this, we believe that it is important to investigate and highlight how these changes have impacted students. What trends are we seeing already? Is AI a detriment or a useful tool for students? What is there to say about Covid-19 and the shift to online learning? Lastly, what are some of the potential long-term impacts of online learning? Numerous studies and articles have investigated and discussed the impacts that these different topics have had on students so far.</p>

        <p>The field of education and learning with artificial intelligence is a very diverse and evolving area. By using AI technology in this field, personalized learning experiences become possible. AI enables students to receive real-time education and serves as a tool for understanding and improving their learning ability. Understanding students' learning ability provides useful information for teachers and enables them to establish individualized teaching plans in the educational process. Additionally, AI can automate tasks in the educational environment, which improves the educational process and enables teachers to secure additional resources in their classes. Considering these factors, AI technology will play a crucial role in the field of education and learning. </p>

        <p><u>Richard: Online learning and COVID 19</u></p>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the educational sector, leading to a significant shift towards online learning (Dhawan, 2020). As traditional face-to-face learning became untenable due to health and safety concerns, educational institutions were compelled to find alternative methods for delivering quality instruction. This rapid transition has presented both challenges and opportunities for the future of education (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020).</p>

        <p>One of the primary consequences of the pandemic was the closure of schools and universities worldwide, which led to the rapid adoption of remote learning and teaching across various educational levels (Marinoni, Van’t Land, & Jensen, 2020). The unprecedented shift to online learning has required educators, students, and parents to adapt to new forms of teaching and communication.
        Case studies, such as Peking University's transition to online learning, highlight the ways institutions can successfully adapt to these new circumstances (Bao, 2020). Central to their success was the ability to effectively leverage digital tools and platforms to deliver course content and facilitate interaction, while still maintaining academic standards.</p>
        
        <p>The global response to COVID-19 revealed a wide range of approaches to online learning and digital pedagogy (Crawford et al., 2020). For instance, some countries, like Finland, adapted quickly and effectively, taking advantage of previous investments in online learning infrastructure and digital competencies. However, other regions faced significant challenges, including inadequate internet access, unequal distribution of resources, and insufficient training for educators. Despite the difficulties experienced during the abrupt shift, this period has also brought about some notable opportunities. Educators and administrators have had the chance to reevaluate traditional teaching methods and identify areas for improvement, potentially leading to more engaging and effective lessons in the future (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020). It has also prompted a reassessment of the role of technology in the classroom and the significance of digital literacy.</p>
        
        <p>In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for change in the educational sector. The increased reliance on online learning has exposed existing challenges and inequalities, but also provided a chance to innovate and adapt. As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing effects of the pandemic, educational institutions must work collaboratively to develop meaningful and lasting solutions, ensuring that learners receive the quality education they deserve.</p>
        
        <p><u>Evon: Long term impacts of online learning</u></p>   
        
        <p>While surveys have shown that student satisfaction is higher while learning online and from home (Istijanto, 2021), the quality of learning, student engagement, and critical thinking has seen a decline and thus has negatively impacted students' education and learning outcomes (Dahleez et al., 2021). This is due to several reasons, students all come from diverse backgrounds and the needs and additional support required in these various scenarios cannot be sufficiently supported entirely via online methods (Dahleez et al., 2021; Trowler et al., 2022). These are some of the factors that contribute to the success of a student e.g.: access to resources outside of the classroom, technological knowledge (and how to navigate online systems provided by education providers), and other external commitments. 
        <br><br>
        Education providers tried to navigate and bridge the differences and gaps that students face with online learning, especially over the Covid-19 lockdowns however there is still a long way to go. Both traditional and e-learning systems need to be implemented in parallel in the education environment for students to thrive and be successful in their studies – One of the many factors brought up, is the usability of new online systems along with the technical ability of both students and teachers alike to use and navigate new online systems in the learning environment, thus causing a vicious cycle. Some teachers are also not able or willing to create an engaging learning environment online (Dahleez et al., 2021). This knock-on effect impacting some students learning outcome, regardless of whether e-learning increases student satisfaction (Istijanto, 2021) and it is recommended that providers incorporate both traditional learning and online learning in a way that benefits all students while considering and supporting the other factors that greatly contribute to a student's success.

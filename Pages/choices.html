        The global response to COVID-19 revealed a wide range of approaches to online learning and digital pedagogy (Crawford et al., 2020).

However, other regions faced significant challenges, including inadequate internet access, unequal distribution of resources, and insufficient training for educators.​

        Despite the difficulties experienced during the abrupt shift, this period has also brought about some notable opportunities. Educators and administrators have had the chance to reevaluate traditional teaching methods and identify areas for improvement, potentially leading to more engaging and effective lessons in the future (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020). It has also prompted a reassessment of the role of technology in the classroom and the significance of digital literacy.

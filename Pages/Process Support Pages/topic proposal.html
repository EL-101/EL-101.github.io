Because of this, we believe that it is important to investigate and highlight how these changes have impacted students. What trends are we seeing already? Is AI a detriment or a useful tool for students? What are we seeing after pandemic and the shift to online learning? Lastly, what are some of the potential long-term impacts of online learning? Numerous studies and articles have started to investigate and discuss some of the impacts that these different topics have had on students so far.</td>

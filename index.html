    <h1>Artificial Intellegence in Education and Learning - WORK IN PROGRESS</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Given the recent global events over the last few years we believe that it is important to 
        look further into these topics. While there may not be a lot of historical data for us to 
        compare against, we still believe we are able to dive into these areas and present some 
        interesting findings more specifically, what are some of the trends we are noticing already 
        within the primary to high-school school groups have the proposed changes to the
        grading system been influenced by COVID19 and the lockdowns or has there been an 
        underlying trend over the last 20 years to get to this stage </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Topics to explore further:</h2>    
    <p>Artificial Intelligence in Education and Learning </p>
    <p>The field of education and learning with artificial intelligence is a very diverse and evolving area. By using AI technology in this field, personalized learning experiences become possible. AI enables students to receive real-time education and serves as a tool for understanding and improving their learning ability. Understanding students' learning ability provides useful information for teachers and enables them to establish individualized teaching plans in the educational process. Additionally, AI can automate tasks in the educational environment, which improves the educational process and enables teachers to secure additional resources in their classes. Considering these factors, AI technology will play a crucial role in the field of education and learning.</p>

    <p>AI technology has various applications in the field of education. For instance, to understand students' learning abilities, AI can track activities performed by students during class hours, gather data, and using that data, it can get insights into which parts the students are struggling with. Based on this, teachers can establish personalized teaching plans for individual students according to their learning comprehension. This customized approach is highly effective in improving students' learning achievements, and AI can streamline some of the tasks involved.</p>
    
    <p>Moreover, AI can automate teachers' duties for extended periods. For example, if manual work like grading test papers or checking for attendance is reduced, teachers can focus more on interacting with students, developing instructional materials, and improving educational processes.</p>
    
    <p>Thus, AI technology in the field of education and learning is providing new forms of learning experiences and contributing to improving student learning achievement by streamlining some of teachers' duties and providing automated support.</p>

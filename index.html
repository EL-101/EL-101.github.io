    <p>Given the recent global events over the last few years, along with the growing popularity of artificial intelligence across all sectors, we believe that it is important and necessary to look further into these areas and explore the new impacts and trends within the education and learning environment.   

        As a society, we have seen and experienced major events in the last several years that shaped how we currently operate on a day-to-day basis, with changes seen across all industries. Because of this, we believe that it is important to investigate and highlight how these changes have impacted students. What trends are we seeing already? Is AI a detriment or a useful tool for students? What is there to say about Covid-19 and the shift to online learning? Lastly, what are some of the potential long-term impacts of online learning? Numerous studies and articles have investigated and discussed the impacts that these different topics have had on students so far.</p>
        
       <p>Richard: Artificial Intelligence in Education and Learning</p>
        
        <p>The field of education and learning with artificial intelligence is a very diverse and evolving area. By using AI technology in this field, personalized learning experiences become possible. AI enables students to receive real-time education and serves as a tool for understanding and improving their learning ability. Understanding students' learning ability provides useful information for teachers and enables them to establish individualized teaching plans in the educational process. Additionally, AI can automate tasks in the educational environment, which improves the educational process and enables teachers to secure additional resources in their classes. Considering these factors, AI technology will play a crucial role in the field of education and learning. </p>

        <p>Richard: Online learning and COVID 19 </p>
        
        <p>Evon: Long term impacts of online learning</p>   
        
        <p>While surveys (reference) have shown that student satisfaction is higher while learning online and from home, studies suggest that the quality of learning, student engagement, and critical thinking has dropped and thus has negatively impacted students' education and learning outcomes. This is due to several reasons, students all come from diverse backgrounds that cannot be sufficiently supported entirely via online methods. These are some of the factors that contribute to the success of a student e.g.: access to resources outside of the classroom, technological knowledge (and how to navigate online systems provided by education providers), and other external commitments. Education providers tried to navigate and bridge the differences and gaps that students face with online learning, especially over the Covid-19 lockdowns however there is still a long way to go, and it is recommended that providers incorporate both traditional learning and online learning in a way that benefits all students while considering and supporting the other factors that greatly contribute to a student's success. </p>

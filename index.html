        <p><u>Why this topic?</u></p>

        <p>Given the recent global events over the last few years and the increasing shift to online learning, along with the growing popularity of artificial intelligence across all sectors, we believe that it is important and necessary to look further into these areas and explore the new impacts and trends within the education and learning environment.   
    
        As a society, we have seen and experienced major events in the last several years that shaped how we currently operate on a day-to-day basis, with changes seen across all industries. Because of this, we believe that it is important to investigate and highlight how these changes have impacted students. What trends are we seeing already? Is AI a detriment or a useful tool for students? Lastly, what are some of the potential long-term impacts of online learning? Numerous studies and articles have started to investigate and discuss some of the impacts and positive influences that these different topics have had on students so far.</p>

        <p>The field of education and learning with artificial intelligence is a very diverse and evolving area. By using AI technology in this field, personalized learning experiences become possible. AI enables students to receive real-time education and serves as a tool for understanding and improving their learning ability. Understanding students' learning ability provides useful information for teachers and enables them to establish individualized teaching plans in the educational process. Additionally, AI can automate tasks in the educational environment, which improves the educational process and enables teachers to secure additional resources in their classes. Considering these factors, AI technology will play a crucial role in the field of education and learning. </p>

        <p><u>Richard: Online learning and COVID 19</u></p>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the educational sector, leading to a significant shift towards online learning (Dhawan, 2020). As traditional face-to-face learning became untenable due to health and safety concerns, educational institutions were compelled to find alternative methods for delivering quality instruction. This rapid transition has presented both challenges and opportunities for the future of education (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020).</p>

        <p>One of the primary consequences of the pandemic was the closure of schools and universities worldwide, which led to the rapid adoption of remote learning and teaching across various educational levels (Marinoni, Van’t Land, & Jensen, 2020). The unprecedented shift to online learning has required educators, students, and parents to adapt to new forms of teaching and communication.
        Case studies, such as Peking University's transition to online learning, highlight the ways institutions can successfully adapt to these new circumstances (Bao, 2020). Central to their success was the ability to effectively leverage digital tools and platforms to deliver course content and facilitate interaction, while still maintaining academic standards.</p>
        
        <p>The global response to COVID-19 revealed a wide range of approaches to online learning and digital pedagogy (Crawford et al., 2020). For instance, some countries, like Finland, adapted quickly and effectively, taking advantage of previous investments in online learning infrastructure and digital competencies. However, other regions faced significant challenges, including inadequate internet access, unequal distribution of resources, and insufficient training for educators. Despite the difficulties experienced during the abrupt shift, this period has also brought about some notable opportunities. Educators and administrators have had the chance to reevaluate traditional teaching methods and identify areas for improvement, potentially leading to more engaging and effective lessons in the future (Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020). It has also prompted a reassessment of the role of technology in the classroom and the significance of digital literacy.</p>
        
        <p>In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for change in the educational sector. The increased reliance on online learning has exposed existing challenges and inequalities, but also provided a chance to innovate and adapt. As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing effects of the pandemic, educational institutions must work collaboratively to develop meaningful and lasting solutions, ensuring that learners receive the quality education they deserve.</p>

        <p><u>Evon: Long term impacts of online learning</u></p>   
        
        <p>Surveys have shown that student satisfaction is higher while learning online and from home (Istijanto, 2021), however, it is important to explore some of the current and potential long-term impacts that online learning may have on students, and review the available literature on this topic and highlight the different aspects we are seeing and what the pedagogical space and education providers should be considering going forward.  

        <br><br> 
        
        A study conducted by Molinillo et al. (2018) emphasized the importance of creating an online learning environment that promotes social interaction as this is a key component that influences active learning especially when collaborating with others and also helps to motivate students to learn and express their ideas with peers. There is a focus on social presence in this study and how it influences student satisfaction and engagement, this is because when a student feels higher levels of social presence it encourages them to put more effort in (Molinillo et al., 2018).
            
        <br><br> 
        
        There are more factors that contribute to student success and engagement within a learning environment, however, with Trowler et al. (2022) bringing attention to a point that has often been overlooked throughout recent global events, students that come from families with lower socio-economic status or that navigate financial hardship often have various obstacles to overcome, and a different approach to learning entirely and different motivators that can shift at any given time that can significantly impact a students ability to engage critically.
        
        Figure 1 presents the different pathways and strategies that should be considered within the learning and pedagogical space (Trowler et al., 2022). </p>

        <br>
        
        <p>When we consider this and review the learning methods that had to be implemented during the pandemic for example and the sudden shift to online learning, we need to acknowledge that there are students that would have greatly suffered during this time and missed out on crucial opportunities to interact and build important connections among peers and teachers that contribute significantly to the learning experience and student engagement (Molinillo et al., 2018). This is especially true when we refer back to the earlier example from Trowler et al. (2022) and the very high chance that some of these students, especially younger students, wouldn't have been able to have access online systems during this period. The long term implications of this on the younger generation can only truly be reviewed and studied in the future.

        <br><br>

        Education providers are trying to navigate and bridge the difficulties and gaps that students can face with online learning, however, there is still a long way to go. Dahleez et al. (2021) brings attention to another critical point about the usability of online systems and the technical ability of both students and teachers alike, with many struggling to navigate the newly implemented systems, combined with scenarios of teachers not able or willing to create an engaging learning environment online (Dahleez et al., 2021). Adding another obstacle for students to face.

        <br><br>

        In summary, there are positives that we are seeing with online learning, it is a great way for students to be active and stay motivated in their learning journey due to the interactive nature of online learning (Molinillo et al., 2018). However, there are many different variables that we need to consider going forward as there is potential for students to be left behind due other external influences that the student may be dealing with (Trowler et al., 2022). Currently, both traditional and online learning systems need to be implemented in parallel in the education environment for students to thrive and be successful in their studies, however it is crutial for education providers to ensure that these new systems are thoroughly reviewed and tested before going live and that they also consider the different obstacles that students face that could hinder their learning.
